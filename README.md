==================

A JS library for creating a 'My favourites' or 'Wish list' using og:metas. There are a few demos on how to use this in the `demos` folder.

Versions
========

v1.0.0 - Add, list, and remove bookmarks from a store

v1.1.0 - Added callbacks for add and delete buttons, so the data can be saved to an external source as well

v1.2.0 - Added ability to override which nodes are used for data, and allow parent nodes, so multiple nodes can be used on one page

v1.3.0 - Allowed extra fields to be passed through, for things like shop items, or movies

v1.4.0 - Made list view templated, so list templates can easily be set

v1.5.0 - Paginated list view. The code to handle changing pages is not included, but the list view can now be called per page
